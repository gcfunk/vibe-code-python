# Vibe Code Python

See if I, as a python novice, can code something non-trivial with copilot, as well as learn more Python in the process

## Files
- `first.py`: Prints a greeting message.
- `snake_game.py`: Classic Snake game where the snake cycles through rainbow colors as it eats.

## How to Run


To run the greeting script:

```
python first.py
```

To play the Snake game:

```
python snake_game.py
```

## Requirements
- Python 3.x

No additional dependencies are required.
